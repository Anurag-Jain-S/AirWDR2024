# <h1 align = 'center'> Air Writing Detection And Recognition </h1>

This project is divided into two parts:

* Detection 
* Recognition 

### Execution:
Execute the air-handwriting-detection-and-recognnition.ipynb with color_selector.py in the same folder if you are running code on jupyter notebook or VS code or any local host machine with replacement of path of dataset and last_frame.png to where you have saved your dataset and last_frame.png.

If execution is done using Google Colab; Execute the detection.py with color_selector.py in the same folder of code using VS Code or prefered python editor and AirWritingDnR2024.ipynb in google colab by uploading last_frame.png into your google drive and replacing the path of both dataset and last_frame.png.

Initially `Training` is set to `True`, Changing it to false will use the trained model but initially you have to train the model.
